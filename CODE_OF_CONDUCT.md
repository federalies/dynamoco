## [Dynamoco community statement](#)

Dynamoco is part of the Federalies, and adopts the Federalies posture of being a  community that enables data ownership, as well as federated applications that respectfully share data without violating owner's intent.

- We are a community of, and in solidarity with people of all kinds - our differences enable the flourishing of perspective. No differences, no new ideas.
- We are all different but united by working on technology so that technology can be made to work for the people - all people. In case you are reading too fast - this is a radical statement. When technology works for people you dont like... you start to realize what ALL people means.
- We acknowledge that not everyone has the time, financial means, or capacity to actively participate, but we recognize and encourage involvement of all kinds. 
- We facilitate and foster access and empowerment. 
- We are all learners.

In practice:

* We are not code snobs. We do not assume knowledge or imply there are things that somebody should know.
* We insist on actively engaging with requests for feedback regardless of their complexity.
* We welcome newcomers and prioritize the education of others. We strive to approach all tasks with the enthusiasm of a newcomer. Because we believe that newcomers are just as valuable in this effort as experts.
* We consistently make the effort to actively recognize and validate multiple types of contributions.
* We are always willing to offer help or guidance.

In times of conflict:

* We listen.
* We clearly communicate while acknowledging other's feelings.
* We admit when we're wrong, apologize, and accept responsibility for our actions.
* We are continuously seeking to improve ourselves and our community.
* We keep our community respectful and open.
* We strive for everyone to feel heard.
* We are mindful and kind in our interactions.

In the future:

* The future is now; it's not just widely distributed. Help us spread it around.

## Dynamoco Project Code of Conduct Statement

* **Be mindful of your language.** Any of the following behavior is unacceptable: 
  * Offensive comments related to gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, or background
  * Threats of violence
  * Deliberate intimidation
  * Sexually explicit or violent material that is not contextualized and preceded by a considerate warning 
  * Unwelcome sexual attention
  * Stalking or following
  * Or any other kinds of harassment

  Use your best judgement. If you have to ask, it if its a good idea. It's best to keep it to your self.

* **Be respectful.** Disagreement is not an opportunity to attack someone else's thoughts or opinions. Although views may differ, remember to approach every situation with patience and care. 
* **Be considerate.** Think about how your contribution will affect others in the community. 
* **Be open minded.** Embrace new people and new ideas. Our community is continually evolving and we welcome positive change.

If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing [dynamocoCodeOfCondut@filters.email](mailto:dynamocoCodeOfCondut@filters.email). Please include your name and a description of the incident, and we will get back to you.

Sometimes, participants violating the Code of Conduct are unaware that their behavior is harmful, and an open conversation clears things up to move forward. However, if a participant continues with the behavior, the Federalies and/or Dynamoco project participants may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Federalies members or the general public.
